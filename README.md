Description
===========

MPOS is a web based Mining Portal for various crypto currencies. It was created by [TheSerapher](https://github.com/TheSerapher) and has hence grown quite large. Recently it was migrated into a Github Organization to make development easier. It's a community driven open source project. Support can be requested on IRC at https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mpos - Be **PATIENT** ...

Requirements
============

This setup has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 13.04 and CentOS.
It should also work on any related distribution (RHEL, Debian).

Be aware that `MPOS` is **only** for pooled mining. Solo Mining is not
supported. They will never match an upstream share, solo miners do not create
any shares, only blocks. Expect weird behavior if trying to mix them. See #299
for full information.

Installation
============

Please take a look at the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mpos/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide). This will give you an idea how to setup `MPOS`. Please be aware that the `master` branch is our currently considered stable system while `development` is used as a test bed for all upcoming changes for `master`. If you wish to run a stable, well tested system ensure you run `git checkout master`. If you decide to stick to the `development` branch with bleeding edge code and potential bugs, just `git clone` the project.
